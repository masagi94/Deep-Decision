There are 3 versions of UDP Server:
- UDP Server Blocking.py - Old version of server, no longer using
- UDP Server Threading.py - New version of server, most up to date
- UDP Server Threading.ipynb - Same as the .py one, but Jupyter Notebook is easier to visualize results with


To run the server with yolov5x on an NVIDIA GPU, use the "UDP Server Threading.py" file instead of the Jupyter Notebook one. Jupyter Notebook will NOT work with the GPU, not sure why.
